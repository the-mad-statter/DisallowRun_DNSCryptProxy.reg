# About

Information Technology at Washington University in Saint Louis uses [Cisco Umbrella](https://umbrella.cisco.com/) for cloud security. This software makes use of DNSCrypt Proxy software to set up a local DNS proxy server which sometimes interferes with authentication into the Washington University in Saint Louis Databricks platform.

The [DisallowRun_DNSCryptProxy.reg](DisallowRun_DNSCryptProxy.reg) file is a Windows registry file that disallows DNSCript Proxy from executing.
